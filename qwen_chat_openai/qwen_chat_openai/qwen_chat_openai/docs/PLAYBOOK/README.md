## Playbook - Realtime Chat (Reusable Kit)

Purpose: zero back-and-forth. This folder is the single source of truth for operating, rebuilding, and extending the app quickly and safely.

Start here
- READ: `DECISIONS.md` (why the stack is the way it is)
- DO: `CHECKLISTS.md` (phone/emulator build + test in minutes)
- RUN: `COMMANDS.ps1` (copy/paste one-liners)
- FIX: `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (symptom â†’ fix)
- KNOW: `ENV.md` (which flags matter and when)
- SHIP: `RELEASE.md` (APK signed, reproducible)
